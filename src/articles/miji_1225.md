The blue whale, the largest animal on Earth, swims through the oceans with a massive body containing billions of cells. In general, the more cells there are, the more likely it is that some of them will turn cancerous. This is because cancer occurs when cells mutate and grow out of control. So, while it might seem that a giant whale with billions of cells would be riddled with cancer, this isn't the case. Surprisingly, these large animals live much longer and remain cancer-free, even compared to smaller animals. Why do elephants and whales, the largest animals on Earth, remain cancer-free compared to smaller animals like mice? Scientists call this phenomenon Peto's Paradox, first observed by Richard Peto, demonstrating that evolution has developed clever ways to protect large animals from cancer. These studies not only help us understand animals, but also provide ideas for preventing and treating cancer in humans.

One of the most interesting questions about Peto's paradox is why, despite having billions of cells, most large animals don't develop cancer. The reason is in the evolution and the ways these animals protect themselves. For example, elephants have multiple copies of a gene called TP53, which detects DNA damage and eliminates potentially dangerous cells. This means that when a cell mutates and could develop into cancer, elephants are more likely to destroy it before it grows out of control. As another example, whales also exhibit unique adaptations. Whale cells have a highly efficient DNA repair system and a slower metabolic rate than smaller animals. This slower metabolic rate reduces the accumulation of cellular damage over time, allowing whales to live healthy lives for decades with low cancer rates. These examples show that evolution has developed different mechanisms across species to prevent cancer.

Studying Peto's Paradox goes beyond simply understanding why large animals rarely develop cancer; it also offers important insights into human health. By observing how elephants, whales, and other animals naturally suppress cancer, scientists can explore new approaches to preventing and treating cancer in humans. For example, multiple copies of the TP53 gene in elephants have inspired research into strengthening tumor-suppressor pathways in humans. Mimicking this natural mechanism could allow for more efficient removal of damaged cells before they develop into cancer. Other strategies discovered in animals may also help treat humans. To illustrate, Naked Molasses produces high-molecular-weight hyaluronic acid, which can modulate the cell environment and reduce tumor formation. Similarly, research on improving DNA repair systems, regulating cell division rates, and managing apoptosis has drawn inspiration from long-lived animals. Beyond cancer prevention, studying these mechanisms can also contribute to our understanding of aging and longevity. The processes that suppress cancer, such as DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, and controlled cell death, also play a role in slowing aging and extending lifespan. By learning from long-lived, healthy animals, we can develop better strategies to maintain human health, reduce age-related diseases, and potentially extend lifespan. Thus, Peto's paradox teaches us that nature has evolved elaborate systems to maintain health even in organisms with billions of cells.

Examples of applying Peto's paradox to human cells. In a preliminary study, scientists inserted the elephant TP53 gene into human osteosarcoma cells, a malignant bone tumor. Surprisingly, the modified cells rapidly underwent apoptosis, causing damaged or cancerous cells to destroy themselves much faster than normal. This experiment shows that a tumor-suppressor gene from a large animal can also affect human cells, suggesting the possibility of developing new treatments. Although this research is still in its early stages and has not yet been applied to clinical trials, it provides concrete evidence that studying cancer-resistant animals like elephants could lead to innovative ideas for treating human cancer.

Peto's paradox shows that large, long-lived animals, with billions of cells, have evolved to prevent cancer in surprising ways. Elephants possess multiple copies of the TP53 gene, whales possess enhanced DNA repair mechanisms. Furthermore, experiments inserting the elephant TP53 gene into human osteosarcoma cells have shown that these natural strategies can also affect human cancer cells, suggesting the potential for developing new treatments. Studying these animals not only broadens our understanding of evolution and biology but also provides important insights into human medicine. By learning how nature addresses cancer, scientists can develop better treatments, prevention strategies, and ways to extend healthy lifespans.

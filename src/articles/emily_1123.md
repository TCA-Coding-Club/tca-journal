## What is a violin?

The name “violin” comes from the medieval Latin word “vitula.” The violin came out of the Italian region of Cremona around 1550, but the first inventor and the exact time of invention are not known.

During the first half of the 16th century, instrument makers from Brescia and Cremona in Northern Italy converted the string instruments that were used at that time into violins. The region of Cremona is famous for having many violin making schools today.

It was around 1550 that violins started to have four strings — G, D, A, and E — as it is today. With the exception of detailed differences depending on the maker's production style, the basic violin structure has not changed for about 400 years. Parts of the body include the upper bout, waist, and lower bout. The waist includes f-holes and bridge, and the lower bout includes fine turner, tailpiece, and chinrest.

## Who are some famous violinists?
Famous violinists include Niccolo Paganini and Asha Heifetz. They all surprised many people by having perfect technique to play with amazing speed and precision. It was rumored that Paganini made a deal with the devil in exchange for his musical abilities.

## How do you take care of a violin?
Violin is a wooden instrument, so special attention should be paid to managing its temperature and humidity. A mismatch between temperature and humidity may cause cracks between the connection of the instrument, resulting in a bad sound. If it is too humid, the sound may be deformed by contraction and expansion of the wood. It is usually recommended to maintain a temperature of 17-22°C and humidity of 50-60%.

During a humid rainy season, you should pay attention to humidity by putting dehumidifying agents in the case. Also, because violins use glues that fall off easily, instruments are often damaged even by small impacts. That's why you should always put it in a case and avoid storing it, for example, in the trunk of a car.

If you haven’t used the violin for a long time, it's good to relax the tension of the string and the bow hair. The bridge supporting the string should also be unbent. Removing the strings when not in use for a long time is a good way to manage bridges and branch boards. After using the bow, it is recommended to wipe the resin on the string with a dry cloth along with other parts of the violin.

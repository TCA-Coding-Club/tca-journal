Pawn is a pledge that the lender takes as a form of security.The main character of this movie is a money lender. They decided to keep a child as a pawn because her mother didn’t give the money back. The plot of the movie starts in 1993 with money lender Du-seok and Jong-bae.  The person on the right in the poster is Du-seok and Jong-bae is on the left. The mother is Korean Chinese who is staying illegally. When she told them that she doesn’t have any money, the two money lenders took the child as a pawn. 

The next day her mother was going to come take her, but she got caught as an illegal alien. So she got sent back to China. Unfortunately, the money lender had to keep the child until her mom comes back and gives back the loan to them. 

While they were driving, the child attempted to run away to see her mother, but thankfully Du-seok found her at the train station. Later when they were in the office, there was a call from who claimed to be the “pawn’s” uncle saying that he will take her and the mother’s debt. Before sending her, Du-seok and Jong-bae had their  last dinner with her. They took her to the subway station, and after she met her uncle they bought her a CD player that she can listen to music and an old communication device called “PPIPPI.”

After they dismissed her, Du-seok arrived at home and called her just in case but she didn’t answer, so he said call him if she went home safely. But the uncle wasn’t her real uncle. He was a stranger who took money to send her to the room salon. While she was working there, one of the customers threw a cup which hit the pawn. She got blood all over her face, but the worker in the salon just put a bandage on her face. When everyone was asleep, she used the phone to call Du-seok, and when he picked up the phone the pawn said that she was in a room salon and requested help. Du-seok and Jong-bae ran to her and took her out of there. They decided to take care of her. 

As time passed she had to attend school, but she couldn’t because she is not Korean or Chinese. However, if Du-seok were to be her father then she could go to school, so he decided to become her adoptive dad. 

She now became a college student. Her mom visits her but she just turns around because she is already living well. But she asks Du-seok if he can help her to meet her mom again. She said she wanted to meet her for the last time before she returns to China. He agrees that he will help to meet her mom. She heard that her real father is still alive. She saw her father secretly but she was sad that he was living so well, and Du-seok made them have dinner together. Du-seok was sad but he still thought it was a good thing she found her Dad. While he was riding the motorcycle, he was suddenly dizzy and got hit by a car. He got brain damage.

When Du-seok was gone, the pawn started looking for him all over the world. She finally went to a mental hospital and found him in a room there. He was very quiet and couldn’t speak properly, but they were so happy because they came together again. The story ended with a hug.

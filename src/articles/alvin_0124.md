Eiffel Tower is very popular. Every year, many tourists visit Paris to see it. The height of the Eiffel Tower is 324 meters, which is the same as a 81 floor building. Before 1930, it was the tallest building in the world. In 1909, It was almost demolished because people in Paris thought that it was really ugly. There are 3 floors for visitors. For the first and second floor, visitors can use both the stairs and an elevator. For the highest third floor, they can only use the elevator. The Eiffel Tower is corroding because of wind and rain.

The tower is named after Gustave Eiffel, who is the architect that designed it. He also helped design parts of the Statue of Liberty. In the Paris Universal Exposition, which commemorates the centenary of the French Revolution, the Eiffel Tower was chosen to be built. 

After the construction of the Eiffel Tower began, citizens of Paris thought that it was rash action. People who lived near the Eiffel Tower sued it, because it harmed the residential environment. After the construction ended, many artists and intellectuals criticized it. They said it does not match Paris, the city of art, and it harms the fine view. At that time, most of the buildings were made with stone, while the Eiffel Tower was made with iron. However, these days, it is considered a beautiful building and a symbol of Paris. It was also registered as a UNESCO world heritage in 1991.

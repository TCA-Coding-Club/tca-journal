In 1933, an astrophysicist named Fritz Zwicky revealed the existence of dark matter. A few physicists didn’t agree with dark matter because it is a hypothetical form of matter that never interacts with light. But still, dark matter is confirmed to make up about 26.8% of the universe. Dark matter is an important part of particle physics and in analyzing formation and evolution of galaxies. Thus, it expands our knowledge of the universe.

## Uncertain Mysteries About Dark matter
Particles in space that don't reflect, absorb, and release light are considered the dark matter. Astrophysicists find it hard to observe dark matter because it never interacts with light and electromagnetic force, making it hard to spot. However, dark matter does interact with gravity of ordinary matter. Dark matter makes up about 26.8% of the universe, while dark energy takes up about 68%. One prediction from astrophysicists about what’s in dark matter are called “WIMPs” (Weakly interacting massive particles)

## Importance and Usage of Dark Matter
Dark matter plays an important role in the formation of galaxies and one beneficial thing is that it can help explain phenomena and occurrences in the universe that are impossible to explain with ordinary matter alone. Also, dark matter can help us understand the size and the shape of the universe in the future. If the amount of dark matter is decreasing, it means that the size of the universe is also decreasing, while the opposite is true if the amount of dark matter is increasing. Thus we can know if the space will become smaller or bigger in the future. Not only that, spaceships don't have to have lots of fuel. This is because they could locate dark matter clusters, and spaceships will accelerate towards them. 

## Conclusion 
Some people might say that dark matter is just a useless thing that exists in the universe, but dark matter is also necessary in understanding the formation of galaxies and figuring out the future of our universe. Once it is fully revealed that dark matter does exist, we can take advantage of it, for example, by using it to accelerate spaceships.  Dark matter’s existence is still not 100% sure, but many astrophysicists and scientists predict it exists.

According to AP News, this summer reached the highest temperature ever recorded. Climate change can also affect things other than temperature. Other negative effects include the economy and food.

Climate change is a long term change in average weather patterns that impact Earth’s local and regional climates which makes it one of the most dangerous disasters. But people still don’t think it is that serious. The main reason for climate change is human activity, and it’s because of many people burning fossil fuels, cutting down forests, and farming livestock. When people burn fossil fuels they release large amounts of carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas which go up to Earth’s atmosphere and trap heat. Thus, climate change can cause a big impact on society.

For economies, it can cause inflation which is increasing prices of products. Inflation is bad because the most obvious impact is the loss of purchasing power. That will have a bad effect on buyers who will need more money to buy products. Sellers will also make less profits from selling products to other people. 

Climate change will give us bad air quality, and food might spoil due to higher temperature, so many people will try to buy foods, drinks, and medicine that have long expiration dates.  Many people will purchase these things so values might increase and the supplies will decrease. For example, when COVID-19 spread all over the world, people were trying to buy masks and the value of masks went up. If this keeps on going, it can cause supply extinction. Climate change also can affect food production. Climate change can disrupt food availability, reduce access to food, and affect food quality. Foods and drinks that we eat daily can be rotten or come in low quality. This is a serious problem because people might starve to death or get sick by not having any food to eat and drink.

Climate change is also in the list of Sustainable Development Goal’s (SDG) that was made by the United Nation (UN). SDG addresses various problems Earth and our societies face, and the 13th problem is climate change. They tell us how serious climate change is, and it is correct. Climate change is undeniably a threat to our entire civilization. The effects are already ongoing and will be worse unless we act now. With education led by the UN, we can still take action for climate change and make the processes slower. Again, climate change is a serious issue that people have to take actions on so that many people can live longer and make Earth a better place by improving economies and food production.

## INTRODUCTION
The image above was created by an AI using a specific prompt. These days, AI is integrated into our lives so seamlessly and naturally that it feels almost impossible to live independently without using it. Before the introduction of the first ubiquitously used AI ChatGPT, people typically searched for information on Google or looked it up in books. However, the way people think and process information has completely changed.  People now rely on diverse open AIs, such as ChatGPT or Perplexity, for information, and use other types of AIs for different purposes. As a result, our mindset on everything has incomparably changed compared to the past. While the development of AI has made our lives more convenient, its rapid development has also negatively affected our ability to think and learn.


## THE INITIAL INTRODUCTION OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
The term “artificial intelligence” was first coined in 1956 at the Dartmouth Conference. Although the first introduction of the concept of artificial intelligence dates back to the 19th century, it was not as widely used as it is today. The real beginning of artificial intelligence’s widespread use came with the release of one of the most popular generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models today, ChatGPT.  It was first introduced to the world in the winter of 2018. However, because of its early limitations in performance, it began to gain popularity in its use in the winter of 2022, when GPT-3.5 was first released to the public. The public opinion at the time was divided into two sides: expectation and concern. Although the majority of the people were filled with expectations and astonishment, looking forward to the benefits of AI in diverse fields such as health, science and security in particular, others expressed deep concern. Since the countless dystopian films that portray AI as the cause of the tragedy date back to 1927, these different opinions from the public are plausible. 


## THE NEGATIVE EFFECT OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THINKING
Despite its convenience, excessive use of AI tools can diminish cognitive abilities. Due to such rapid and sophisticated developments of artificial intelligence and its growing role in automated analysis, students who are particularly susceptible to these technologies may become overly reliant on them. Heavy reliance can lead to problems such as diminished critical and analytical thinking and decision-making skills, increased vulnerability to AI-generated errors or AI hallucinations, higher rates of plagiarism, challenges due to a lack of transparency, and algorithmic biases. Furthermore, relying on AI for decision-making can reduce individuals’ motivations to think and analyze independently, ultimately weakening essential cognitive abilities and encouraging automation bias. This over-reliance can limit both the educators’ and learners’ creativity and innovative thinking, potentially leading to a decline in the overall quality of education. 

Also, a study by Gerlich in 2025 found a negative correlation between frequent AI usage and critical thinking abilities, showing that individuals who rely heavily on AI may struggle with independent reasoning. One withdrawal is cognitive offloading, which occurs when external tools or resources reduce the effort for deep, reflective thinking. The frequent use of quick, simple AI can consequently lead to the deprivation of certain cognitive skills, such as critical thinking and memory. 
Moreover, the study also examined the impact of age and education on AI reliance. Younger individuals relied more heavily on AI tools and scored lower in critical thinking assessments compared to the older participants. However,  higher levels of education were related to stronger reasoning abilities, even among those frequently exposed to AI. Additionally, as trust in AI-generated content increased, independent verification of that content decreased, raising concerns about a decline in skepticism.

Another issue related to AI usage is algorithmic bias, which shapes the information users are exposed to. Because AI systems can process vast amounts of data and generate accurate predictions, they often filter information based on past interactions, reinforcing existing biases and limiting exposure to diverse perspectives. Interestingly, the study also discovered a non-linear relationship between AI usage and cognitive impact. Moderate use of AI did not significantly impact critical thinking, whereas excessive reliance on it diminished cognitive returns. 

## CONCLUSION
The image used for this article is from a design website, similar to Canva. Although it is not an image-generating platform, the quality of the image is virtually indistinguishable from one created by a human.  AI is developing too rapidly, and has integrated into our lives so seamlessly that it is difficult to imagine a post-AI world. The continued development of artificial intelligence will inevitably affect human life, whether in positive or negative ways.

## Introduction
Nowadays, many people visit fast food shops, such as McDonald's, Burger King, and convenience stores to eat meals easily, but in other ways, this has become a social issue leading to health problems, diabetes, heart attacks, and high blood pressure. Therefore, health issues and their relationship with junk foods are a rising issue. For instance,  one of the YouTubers has filmed a video in which he experiments with eating junk food each day for 1 month and checks his body condition. Also, there are scholarly articles claiming that it also harms mental health. Consequently, a heightened awareness of junk food would improve life quality greatly 

## Body
To begin with, eating junk food has many devastating effects. Even though when listed, there are too many symptoms, eating junk food every day primarily causes these effects: On the first day, one feels powerless. This is because the blood vessels start to be blocked. Soon, one will gain weight, blood pressure will increase, and start to feel sick.   If eating fast food is continued for more than a month,  these symptoms start to rise: overweight, less energetic, stressed, sleepy, and high blood pressure. Since these symptoms are related to cholesterol,  they lead to Type 2 diabetes, heart attack, liver problems, and cause many cancers, including brain tumors. Thus, junk food should be avoided as it causes many serious health problems..

Also, eating junk food is harmful to our mental health. This is because mass eating junk food leads to sleepiness and general powerlessness. One scholarly article stated that eating junk food is directly related to sleepiness, less energy, and stress, which all cause the blocking of blood vessels and a high sugar rate. For example, going to McDonald’s and eating a Big Mac burger set would cause fatigue and blood sugar spikes. Furthermore, eating too much junk food could cause depression, anxiety, and addiction to junk food. 

As a result, one can improve health by being aware of junk food. As many scientists have said, junk food harms your body, meaning that not eating junk food would lead to many health benefits. First,  energy levels will start to go up. Also, almost immediately, blood pressure will slowly go down. Next, after 12 hours to 24 hours have passed, your blood sugar level decreases, preventing high blood pressure and heart attack. Then, a few days later, addiction to any high sugar rate food and fried food will slowly disappear. Soon, after a week,  energy levels and emotional conditions will return to a normal person's health. If one doesn’t eat any junk food for a month, weight will slowly (if no exercise at all) or quickly (if there is exercise) drop. After a whole year, health and mental conditions will both be at an optimal level

## Conclusion 
In conclusion, most fast foods are not good for our bodies and mental health.  For instance, eating too much fast food and junk food can cause cancers, Type 2 diabetes, heart attack, high blood pressure, etc. As a result, banning junk food could produce many health benefits and increase the general quality of one’s life.

Quantum computing, a rising field, is expected to provide humans with substantial advancements in the area of computer science. It possesses the potential to revolutionize industries, research methods, and data processing in computers. Built upon the principles of quantum mechanics, quantum computers are capable of providing solutions to problems that were unsolvable in traditional computers and are able to execute them in the blink of an eye. As demand rises for faster and more efficient computers, quantum computing is gaining its position as a game changer in the field. 

Traditional computers can only function on bits, which are numbers 0 and 1. To be specific, these bits are the basis of all the information processing and calculations performed inside the computer. On the other hand, quantum computers include quantum bits, also referred to as qubits. Qubits, unlike typical bits, can exist in a superposition of states, which means that they can be both 0 and 1. This allows quantum computers to process large amounts of data simultaneously, rocketing the computational efficiency for specific tasks. Further, quantum computing allows entanglement to happen. Entanglement is a phenomenon where qubits are interconnected so that the state of one qubit influences that of another without considering the physical distance between the two. This creates a kind of link that allows the qubits to work simultaneously, unlike traditional bits. This process is essential for quantum algorithms and quantum speedup to happen. 

Practical applications of quantum computing are being widely researched, and one of them is in cryptography. Most methods of encryption these days rely hugely on factoring large numbers, which is difficult for traditional computers. Contrastingly, quantum computers can utilize Shor’s algorithm to factor in a short period. Shor’s algorithm is a type of quantum algorithm developed by Peter Shor, a mathematician, in 1994. This algorithm theoretically allows an exponential boost in factoring large numbers. Many current encryption systems like RSA rely on the fact that factoring large numbers is difficult, meaning that Shor’s algorithm could jeopardize the current encryption methods. Thus, to prevent this from happening, researchers are currently developing methods to resist quantum attacks. Moreover, quantum computers are designed to model atoms, molecules, and materials, so their functions relate to fields such as chemistry, physics, and biology. Most traditional computers struggle with modeling the atoms because the calculations become too complicated for them to execute. Some quantum algorithms are capable of enhancing existing search algorithms, logistics, and AI functions through improving their efficiency. One such algorithm is Grover’s algorithm, which provides a boost for unstructured search problems. If current algorithms need n steps to finish their task, Grover’s algorithm takes about root n steps. 

However, quantum computing not only has benefits, but it also has significant challenges. One significant challenge is decoherence, which happens when external noise or interaction affects the qubits, resulting in issues. Since quantum systems are extremely sensitive, even small stimuli can destroy the qubits’ states. Also, unlike normal bits, qubits cannot be copied or even observed without being disturbed in any way. To solve this issue, methods like surface codes are being developed. Quantum error correction is the process of solving this issue through detecting and fixing errors without influencing the qubit states. Current quantum computers only have a few hundred qubits, but for them to function in real life, millions of qubits might be required. As a result, many companies like IBM, Google, and Intel are researching possible real-life applications. 

Many organizations are focusing on quantum computing and are looking for future potential. Thus, government initiatives are also looking for possible developments. The U.S. National Quantum Initiative and other similar institutions are funding research and training experts in this field. Additionally, large tech corporations like IBM, Google, Microsoft, and Intel are all constructing physical quantum processors. For example, IBM aims to reach over a thousand qubits in the future. An essential term in understanding quantum computing is quantum advantage, which is a point where quantum computers can solve real-life problems faster than traditional computers. According to Google, this is possible for specific tasks as of today, and broader applications are still impossible. 

To sum up, most industries nowadays are looking forward to future developments in quantum computing. Compared to traditional computers, quantum computers utilize qubits to process information rapidly and simultaneously. What’s more is that quantum computers can revolutionize a variety of industries, allowing a general boost in productivity. Although significant barriers still remain, results of recent research have been promising, and ongoing investments are constantly transforming quantum computing into reality. Its success will leave a significant legacy in the area of computer science and will remain one of the greatest technological innovations of mankind.

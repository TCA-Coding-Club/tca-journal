Have you ever experienced intense discomfort while watching a character in a movie or a television drama acting awkwardly or making a socially confusing mistake? Although the situation is fictional, many viewers react by closing their eyes, looking away, or putting their heads down. These reactions are examples of second-hand embarrassment, a psychological phenomenon in which an observer feels embarrassed for another person who violates social norms. Psychology surveys suggest that around 60–70% of people report experiencing second-hand embarrassment in everyday situations, especially while watching media or observing social interactions. So, why does this happen?

One main reason people experience second-hand embarrassment is empathy. Empathy allows people to understand how others might feel in a situation. When watching a character act awkwardly, viewers often imagine what it would feel like to be in that position. Even if the character does not seem embarrassed, the viewer may still feel discomfort because they understand how the behavior could be judged by others. This shows that second-hand embarrassment does not depend on the character’s emotions, but on the observer’s social awareness. This reaction occurs because people are highly aware of how behavior is judged in social settings. The brain quickly recognizes actions that could lead to embarrassment or rejection. As a result, the observer emotionally responds to the situation as if it were happening to them. This explains why fictional scenes can feel intense and uncomfortable to watch.

The reactions that second-hand embarrassment often leads to are physical reactions such as closing one’s eyes, looking away, or putting one’s head down. These reactions are examples of avoidance behavior. Avoidance is a way the brain protects itself from emotional overload by reducing exposure to uncomfortable situations. When viewers feel overwhelmed by an awkward scene, they instinctively try to block it out. This response is usually automatic and not something people consciously decide to do. Even though viewers know the situation is fictional, the emotional reaction feels realistic. Avoidance helps lower emotional stress and allows the individual to regain control over their feelings. This explains why many people respond physically rather than simply ignoring the scene or turning off the screen.

Social norms play an important role in second-hand embarrassment as well. Social norms are unwritten rules that guide how people are expected to behave in public. When a character breaks these rules, such as acting in a confusing or socially inappropriate way, viewers often feel uncomfortable. This discomfort increases when the behavior is unpredictable or difficult to understand. People prefer predictable social behavior because it allows them to anticipate outcomes and feel secure. When a character’s actions do not follow expected patterns, the brain struggles to make sense of the situation. This uncertainty increases emotional discomfort, making the scene harder to watch. As a result, second-hand embarrassment becomes stronger during moments of poor decision-making or unclear intentions. 

Second-hand embarrassment is not limited to movies or television shows; it also appears in everyday social situations. People may feel uncomfortable watching a classmate give an awkward presentation, hearing someone say the wrong thing in a conversation, or witnessing an uncomfortable public interaction. These reactions show that second-hand embarrassment plays a role in real-life social awareness, not just entertainment. The emotion can influence behavior by making individuals more cautious about their own actions and more aware of how others might perceive them. In this way, second-hand embarrassment may help reinforce social norms by reminding people which behaviors are considered acceptable. Although the feeling is uncomfortable, it can encourage greater sensitivity to others and promote smoother social interactions.

Not everyone experiences second-hand embarrassment in the same way. Some individuals are more sensitive to social situations and may feel stronger discomfort when watching awkward scenes. People with higher levels of empathy or social awareness are more likely to react intensely because they pay closer attention to how their behavior is judged by others. Cultural background can also influence how people experience second-hand embarrassment. In cultures that emphasize social harmony and appropriate behavior, violating social norms may feel more uncomfortable to observe. These differences help explain why some viewers easily tolerate awkward scenes, while others find them almost unbearable.

Second-hand embarrassment shows that human emotions are deeply social rather than purely individual. The discomfort people feel while watching awkward moments reflects the brain’s constant attention to social rules and relationships, even when no real consequences exist. This reaction suggests that empathy is not only about caring for others but also about protecting social harmony. Understanding second-hand embarrassment helps explain why people react strongly to fictional situations and highlights how social awareness shapes emotional responses in everyday life.
